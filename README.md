# Accident-Alerting-System-Using-GSM-shield
This was a kind of basic project I have involved with one of my friend who was studying at a engineering education Institute. The target was an accident alerting system for a vehicle.    When the car getting closer to a vehicle alerting system gives a beep pulse sound to alert the driver. The driver can manually silent the alarm by separated push button switch. If the vehicle gets very closer (7cm as an example) system gives an emergency alarm to indicate an accident. The driver still can silence the alarm and ignore the incidence as a mistake by pressing the same button mentioned above within a minute.    Unless the driver presses the button within a minute system to consider this as an accident and sends SMS to the family and police with the GPS coordinates of the vehicle, time and information of the accident. Then it automatically makes a missed call to the family as the SMS do not give an urgent alert. however as my thoughts this method has a tedious part with sing an ultra sonic sensor.
